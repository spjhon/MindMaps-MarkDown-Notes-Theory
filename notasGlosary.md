# GENERAL PROGRAMMING

## Notation

: In JavaScript, "notation" typically refers to the way you access properties or elements of objects, arrays, or other data structures. There are two main notations used in JavaScript: Dot Notation and Bracket Notation.

## Syntax

: refers to the set of rules and principles that define the structure and format of a programming language. These rules dictate how programs are written, specifying how different language elements (such as keywords, operators, functions, variables, etc.) should be structured and combined to create valid and meaningful code.

## Statement

: A statement can perform various tasks such as assigning values to variables, performing arithmetic operations, calling functions, defining control flow (loops and conditionals), and more. Each statement ends with a semicolon (;), although JavaScript allows you to omit semicolons in certain cases, thanks to a feature called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI).

# HTML

## singleton tag

: HTML element that does not have a closing tag. Instead, it is self-closed within a single tag.


# REACT

## stateful component

: A stateful component is a component whose behavior depends on its state. This means that two separate instances of the component if given the same props will not necessarily render the same output, unlike pure function components.
: Stateful components are class components or function components that use stateful Hooks.
: Stateful components have their state initialized in the constructor or with useState().
